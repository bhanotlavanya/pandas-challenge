# Pandas-Challenge
In this challenge I have worked on 2 files in which data about students marks in the subject of maths and reading is given for the grade of 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th is given.
In the second csv file data about schools, there type, there size and there budget is provided.
To work on these files I have choosed Jupyter Notebook and I have used pandas, pathlib and numpy dependicies.
After opening and reading the csv files in Jupyter, I have merged the 2 csv's

# District Summary
Using the len method I have found that there are 15 schools and total number of students are 39170.
The total money spent in these schools is 24649428.
Average maths and reading score 78 and 81 respectively and 74% of total students passed in maths where as in reading it was 85%. The total students who passed in both maths and reading were 65%

# School Summary
There are mainly two types of schools types which are Charter and district.
I have counted the number of students in each school which helped me in seeing the school budget and then calculating the budget per capita grouped by school.
I have calculated the average scores of maths and reading per school as well. Then I have calculated the number of students who passed both maths and reading.

# Highest Performing Schools
The top highest performing schools are Charter.

# Bottom Performing Schools
The bottom performing schools are all District.

# Math Scores
Here all the students have been grouped by the grades and there school and there average marks for Maths is being shown.

# Reading Scores
Here all the students have been grouped by the grades and there school and there average marks for Reading is being shown.

# Scores by School Spending
Here an analysis of per student budget is done which is grouped by school and there reading and maths scores are shown. They are not directly propotional.

# Scores by School Size
Here an analysis of students per class is done grouped by school and there reading and maths scores are shown. The lower the number of students the greater are the scores.
# Important Findings
Maths and Reading scores are relatable for all the grades
Charter schools are top performers
District schools are the bottom performers
Generally we feel the schools who have higher per capita budget will perform well but in this data set it is not true. The best performing school had low per capita budget.
The schools with less than 2000 students were the better performer compared the rest.
While comparing Charter and District scores, the students who passed reading are close but there is a huge gap between students passing maths. The Average maths and reading scores are still similiar.
